== About me
I'm currently Ph.D candidate (2019-present) at Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, co-advised by Professor [https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/kaan-ozbay Kaan Ozbay] and Professor [https://jinli.ji.sjtu.edu.cn Li Jin]. 
Previously, I received M.S. in traffic control from Tongji University in 2019 and B.S. in traffic engineering from Tongji University in 2016.
My research applies control theory, learning theory and stochastic processes to design resilient and safe cyber-physical-human systems, especially with an emphasis on intelligent transportation systems.
